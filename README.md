# ML_Project_G39_2024

## Description
This repository contains code for ML project made by group number 39 on a course of Machine Learning in NOVA IMS in 2024-2025.

## Data
Unfortunately, data for this project was very large, so the data had to be excluded from this github repository. This is done by
removing tracking of all .csv files from the repository. 
  ##### NOTE
If the output of predictions is .csv AND you want to include the results to git, REMOVE *.csv from .gitignore, and replace it 
with full names of the training and testing data. (like this: .train_data.csv etc)
