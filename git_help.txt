SETUP
1. Download git from internet if you do not have it already.
2. Clone this repository to an EMPTY folder on your computer
    - In VSCode, open terminal.
    - Navigate to the empty foler on terminal.
    - In empty folder, insert command "git clone https://github.com/OnniMansikkamaki/ML_Project_G39_2024.git"
    - Now you have the code on your computer. You will be in branch called master

WORK ON YOUR OWN IN YOUR OWN BRANCH
1. Check out in which branch you are in with "git status". This command is always helpful in every step of ANY git process.
2. IF you already have a new branch or you want to make changes in some spesific exiosting branch, move to that branch with 
    "git checkout <branch_name_here>"
3. ELSE: ALWAYS BEFORE CREATING A NEW BRANCH, USE GIT PULL TO GET UPDATD CODES FROM EVERYONE
4. Make a new branch by "git checkout -b <name_of_new_branch_here>"
5. To check all possible branches just type "git branch"
6. NOW MAKE YOU CODE CHANGES OR CREATE NEW CODE OR WHATEVER YOU WANT

PUBLISH YOU BRANCH FOR EVERYONE TO SEE
1. Check "git status". There you can see you have made changes
2. To add your changes to commit, "git add ." This adds all your changes to the commit
3. To commit your changes to this branch (kind of save the changes), 'git commit -m "MESSAGE EXPLAINING YOUR CHANGES HERE" '
4. To publish your changes (and also to make the branch visible for everyone if this is your
    frist code change in this branch) for everyone to see in this branch (your branch) "git push". First time you do it, you will
    run into error code, but IT WILL SAY YOU WHAT YOU NEED TO DO! After that, just run "git push" again.
5. Now your changes are visible for everyone in your branch

MERGE YOUR BRANCH TO BE PART OF THE MASTER BRANCH'S CODE
1. When we are ready to merge your changes to be part of our final code (Final code always is ONLY in master branch)
    is time to do a git merge process.
2. MAKE SURE THAT THERE ARE NO ERRORS AT ALL IN THE CODE AT THIS POINT. TEST YOUR CODE THAT IT WORKS AND THAT IT WILL NOT BREAK
    ANY OTHER CODE.
3. First navigate to master branch by "git checkout master"
4. Then type "git merge <branch_name_here>"
